# Community-preserving Graph Convolutions for Structural and Functional Joint Embedding of Brain
In this paper, we propose a framework of Siamese communitypreserving graph convolutional network (SCP-GCN) to learn the
structural and functional joint embedding of brain networks.
Specifically, we use graph convolutions to learn the structural
and functional joint embedding, where the graph structure is
defined with structural connectivity and node features are from
the functional connectivity. Moreover, we propose to preserve
the community structure of brain networks in the graph convolutions by considering the intra-community and inter-community
properties in the learning process. Furthermore, we use Siamese
architecture which models the pair-wise similarity learning to
guide the learning process. To evaluate the proposed approach,
we conduct extensive experiments on two real brain network
datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach in structural and functional
joint embedding for neurological disorder analysis, indicating its
promising value for clinical applications.
